---------------------------

## Project Objectives

- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for the business.
- Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize trends and patterns using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- Build a dashboard-style Jupyter Notebook with clear steps and markdowns.

---------------------------

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- **Order information**
- **Revenue**
- **Locations (in Korean, translated to English)**
- **Dates and times**
- **Items sold**

---------------------------

## Key Metrics Calculated
